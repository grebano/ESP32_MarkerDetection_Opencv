# Square Detection
## Introduction
Standalone code that can run on a ESP32-AI-Thinker board to detect squares in images. The project is based on the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library and uses the [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/) framework. The code is written in C++ and uses the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system.
